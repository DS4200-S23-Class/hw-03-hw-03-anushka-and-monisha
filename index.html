            <ul>
                <li>Electoral Vote Indicator: Areas
                <li>Map: Areas

            <ol>

                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the two seperate 2016 canidate's, specifically their political party affiliation
                    <li>This channel was a good idea because it color is an easily perceptible channel and this attribute of political party affiliation is a well-known one that is consistently identified by two distinct colors: red and blue. Also, it is a proper identity channel
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>Colormaps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Categorical
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents political party affiliation of each 2016 canidate
                    <li>This colormap was a good idea because the attrubte being represented is categorical. The data does not have a range or difference in values on the sam scales. With a nominal attribute like political parties, it is best represented with a categorical colormap.

                        I think the color choices are a bit difficult to intuitivey identify and below/above average. Instead using red and green
                        would have been a better choice in my opinion.
