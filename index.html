            <ul>
                <li>Map: Areas</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Channels</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Color(hue)
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the two seperate 2016 candidate's, specifically their political party affiliation</li>
                    <li>This channel was a good idea because it color is an easily perceptible channel and this attribute of
                         political party affiliation is a well-known one that is consistently identified by two distinct colors:
                          red and blue. Also, it is a proper identity channel</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>Colormaps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Categorical</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents political party affiliation of each 2016 candidate</li>
                    <li>This colormap was a good idea because the attrubte being represented is categorical. 
                        The data does not have a range or difference in values on the same scales. With a nominal attribute 
                        like political parties, it is best represented with a categorical colormap. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Batted Balls: Points</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Channels</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Color(hue) and Saturation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents if the scoring value of batted balls was higher or lower than average LWTS</li>
                    <li>This channel was a good idea, as colors and their intensities are a good way to demonstrate magnitudes.</li>
                    <li>The Color(hue) channel is an Identity, categorical attribute, where as the color saturation is a Magniture, ordered attribute</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Position(vetrical and horizontal)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents two attributes both the launch angles (vertical) and exit velocity (horizontal) for each batted ball based on their position</li>
                    <li>This channel is a good idea as the position of each point can indicate two numerical and continous attributes effectively and it helps demonstrate how these attributes can contribute to the scoring value(color) of the batted ball </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>Colormaps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Divergent</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the magnitude of scoring values of batted balls based on saturation and hue that has range of colors with two extremes and nuetrals colors in between</li>
                    <li>This colormap made it a bit difficult to intuitivey identify below/above average balls. 
                        Instead of orange and purple, using red and green would have been a better choice in my opinion.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Marks</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Each individual irises: points</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Channels</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Color(hue)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the different species of flower</li>
                    <li>This channel was a good idea because color is an easily perceptible channel and can clearly show the different categories(species) of the flowers.</li>
                    <li>This channel is an Identity, categorical attribute</li>
                <li>Position(Both Vertical & Horizontal):
                <ul>
                    <li>The vertical position represents the attribute of petal width of the irisies and the horizontal position represnts the petal width of the irises.</li>

                    <li>This channel of position was a good choice because both attributes are continous variables and in scatter plot, the numerical values of two attributes in a range are well-represented positionally in two dimensions. </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>Colormaps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Categorical</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the specific species of flower</li>
                    <li>This colormap was a good idea because the colors are distinct enough that people won't get confused 
                        as to which color corresponds to each species. There also isn't a need for an ordering, so not using any of those channel attributes was a good choice.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
