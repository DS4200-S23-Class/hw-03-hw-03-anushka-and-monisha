            <ul>
                <li>Electoral Vote Indicator: Areas</li>
                <li>Map: Areas</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Channels</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Color(hue)
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the two seperate 2016 candidate's, specifically their political party affiliation</li>
                    <li>This channel was a good idea because it color is an easily perceptible channel and this attribute of
                         political party affiliation is a well-known one that is consistently identified by two distinct colors:
                          red and blue. Also, it is a proper identity channel</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>Colormaps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Categorical</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents political party affiliation of each 2016 candidate</li>
                    <li>This colormap was a good idea because the attrubte being represented is categorical. 
                        The data does not have a range or difference in values on the same scales. With a nominal attribute 
                        like political parties, it is best represented with a categorical colormap. </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Channels</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Color(hue) and Saturation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents if the scoring value of batted balls was higher or lower than average LWTS</li>
                    <li>This channel was a good idea, as colors and their intensities are a good way to demonstrate magnitudes.</li>
                    <li>The Color(hue) channel is an Identity, categorical attribute, where as the color saturation is a Magniture, ordered attribute</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Spatial Region</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the type of ball the batted ball is based on area on the chart</li>
                    <li>This channel is a good idea as it the area on the map clearly shows the different categories of balls that were batted</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>Colormaps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Divergent</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Represents the magnitude of scoring values of batted balls based on saturation and hue</li>
                    <li>This colormap made it a bit difficult to intuitivey identify below/above average balls. 
                        Instead of orange and purple, using red and green would have been a better choice in my opinion.</li>

                    <li>Represents the different species of flower</li>
                    <li>This channel was a good idea because color is an easily perceptible channel and can clearly show the different categories(species) of the flowers.</li>
                    <li>This channel is an Identity, categorical attribute</li>

                    <li>Represents the specific species of flower</li>
                    <li>This colormap was a good idea because the colors are distinct enough that people won't get confused 
                        as to which color corresponds to each species. There also isn't a need for an ordering, so not using any of those channel attributes was a good choice.</li>
